## The 5 pittfalls that make software scale-ups fail (and what you should do about it)

## Problems
Growing a software startup into a scale-up is hard. It requires a shift in thinking and very specific leadership skills.
<br></br>
In this blog I am describing a set of problems and patterns that I have observed in many scale-ups.
If not addressed, these can be detrimental to the future of these organisations and could ultimately lead to failure.<br></br>For each identified problem I will try to give a tangible solution, here we go!

###1. Scaling up quickly over scaling up organically
Expansion of the development teams and capabilities are not always driven by an organic need in terms of output or concrete goals 
and objectives. Sometimes the expansion is driven by future expectations and pressure from investers to go fast. Scaling up then becomes
a goal in itself. <br></br>Sometimes organisational growth is driven
by concrete targets but the only reflex known is just to add more bodies in the assumption that velocity will at least somewhat go up.
<br></br>
The result then comes as a surprise: When adding resources too quickly it becomes very hard to uphold or create things like healthy development practices and team purpose. There is alo a
cost associated with more complex communication patterns in and between bigger teams.
<br></br>The problem becomes visible in the form of lower velocity, lower predictability and lower quality. It is undoubtly tied in with a number of other problems listed in this blog. 

<b>Organic growth is to add only so many resources that enable you to maintain an increasing the number of features that can be released</b> while maintaining healthy development practices</b>. 
DORA and technical depth metrics could be helpful to monitor this. <b>Stalling progress in these metrics can be an indicator that to stop or slow down in your hiring process</b>. 

###2. Backlog filled with low business value items and no way to determine value
Scaling up also implies more pressure on filling the backlogs. In terms of 


###3. Several teams working in isolation on different value streams

###4. Loss of contact with the end-user product in development team

###5. Only focussing on functionality and forgetting enablement for the teams to take end-to-end responsibilty

###6. Creating heavy business processes and to much focus on 'allignment'

A symptom of the problem is scale-up that makes you feel like you are part of a big corporate environment. Software release procedures are long and cumbersome. Getting a new laptop requires filling in a form.

## Solutions


Development doesn't understand business needs
##Conclusions


There is so much to do!
Increasing developer experience\
Enable measurement of the development process\
Implementing a strategy for technical and functional monitoring from the get-go and building it into the product\
Focus on the top 3 valuable items for your clients and  or end-users and swarm around these\
Share a tangible product strategy with your development teams (s)


Ultimately, the maturity of the leadership and product management teams matter in being able to set the proper expectations
