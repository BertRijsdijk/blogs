# The 5 pittfalls that make software scale-ups fail (and what you should do about it)

## The challenge
Growing a software startup into a scale-up is hard. This phase of a company requires a shift in thinking and very specific leadership skills.
<br></br>
In this blog I am describing a set of problems and patterns that I have observed in many scale-ups.
If not addressed, these can be detrimental to the future of these organisations and could ultimately lead to failure.<br></br>For each identified problem I will try to give a tangible solution, here we go!

## 1. Scaling up quickly over scaling up organically
Expansion of the development teams and capabilities are not always driven by an organic need in terms of output or concrete goals 
and objectives. Sometimes the expansion is driven by future expectations and pressure from investers to go fast. Scaling up then can become
a goal in itself. <br></br>Sometimes organisational growth is driven
by concrete targets but the only reflex known is just to add more bodies in the assumption that velocity will at least keep going up to an extent. 
<br></br>
The result then comes as a surprise: When adding resources too quickly it becomes very hard to instill or uphold things like healthy development practices and team purpose. There is alo a
cost associated with more complex communication patterns in and between bigger teams.
<br></br>The problem becomes visible in the form of lower velocity, lower predictability and lower quality. It is undoubtly tied in with a number of other problems listed in this blog. 

<b>Organic growth is to add only so many resources that enable you to maintain an increasing the number of features that can be released</b> a.k.a. <b> working software in production</b> 
while maintaining healthy development practices. 
DORA and technical-dept metrics could be helpfull to determine this. <b>Stalling progress in these metrics can be an indicator that to stop or slow down in your hiring process</b>. Consider working on 
increasing the key metrics first before you can start hiring again.

## 2. Backlog filled with low business value items an/or missing system to determine value

Under the stress of demanding stakeholders, clients and investors the backlogs get filled up quickly while the company is still learning about it's value and mission. 
The result is an enormous body of potential work with undetermined value. Hell, even the growth of the development team itself will lead to more backlog items as most employees 
will likely try to be useful and suggest improvements and things they need to do to make the product and developer experience better.

The problem becomes visible in the form of long backlogs where PBI's miss business value, prioritisation becomes difficult and missing objective business value criteria. 
A missing written product goal is also a red flag as well as missing business goals to measure the succes of the software against. 

In organisations that have this problem software teams often lack a sense of purpose.

When you are finding yourself in this spot consider the following ways to make it better:
<b>
1. Create a system to determine business value in an objective way. Think for example of a scorecard for PBI's against business goals or company mission 
2. Measure and score backlog items against it, for example through business value poker
3. Callibrate the sytem with your product management team so it get's better over time 
4. Always include metrics how to measure success for each feature
5. Use measurements to Re-iterate on the business goals and company vision
6. Repeat scoring!
</b>
<br>

Succes depends on using such system with disipline. Letting go of a feature where you invested in 
emotionally or financially is hard. It could be tempting to game the system. It requires leadership and coaching 
of product management goals 
 
Besides that I recommend reading the lean startup by Eric Ries (yes, even though you consider yourself
a scale-up) and the proffesional product owner.  
## 3. Several teams working in isolation on different value streams



## 4. Loss of contact with the end-user product in development team
Strongly correlated to #3 we often see teams that have a narrow technical mission which is not coupled to the working end-user product

## 5. Only focussing on functionality and forgetting enablement for the teams to take end-to-end responsibilty

## 6. Creating heavy business processes and to much focus on 'allignment'

A symptom of the problem is scale-up that makes you feel like you are part of a big corporate environment. Software release procedures are long and cumbersome. Getting a new laptop requires filling in a form.

## Solutions


Development doesn't understand business needs
##Conclusions


There is so much to do!
Increasing developer experience\
Enable measurement of the development process\
Implementing a strategy for technical and functional monitoring from the get-go and building it into the product\
Focus on the top 3 valuable items for your clients and  or end-users and swarm around these\
Share a tangible product strategy with your development teams (s)


Ultimately, the maturity of the leadership and product management teams matter in being able to set the proper expectations

Scaling up also implies bigger backlogs that need to be filled. There are two sides to this phenomenon.
More people will work and create ideas which will often lead to backlog items and the expectancy of more capacity itself can
trigger more promises and variants on product offering.
