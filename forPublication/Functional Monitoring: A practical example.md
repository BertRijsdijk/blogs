## Why Functional Monitoring?
Monitoring is as a crucial part of a successful Continuous Delivery strategy. Yet, monitoring often 
is primarily focussed on technical metrics like instance health and error rate. 

These metrics are useful but
don't tell the real story from the end-user perspective. For instance, all services could be "green", while our customers experience broken functionality. 

Functional Monitoring helps to understand if the system works from a usage perspective.

## How do I start with Functional Monitoring?
To help us reason about Functional Monitoring and decide on a strategy we came up with a categorisation of 
4 distinct but complementary types which nicely fit in a quadrant, lets call it the Functional Monitoring Quadrants  

On the horizontal axis we differentiate activity that is coming from actual usage 
as opposed to simulated activity also know as synthetic testing.

On the vertical axis we differentiate activity which is direct user-facing 
versus indirect user-facing or implementation facing.

## Functional Monitoring by Example
### Case study: A checkout flow

Consider the example here.

###User Flow Monitoring
####Goal
Measure availability and performance of a critical business flow from the userâ€™s perspective.
####Example
I play a recorded checkout flow through the user's
perspective. I measure that the scenario works end-to-end
####Limitation
Assumption based happy flow. Users might follow a different path with unexpected problems, these will not be found pro-actively.
Subject to continuous maintenance.

###API Endpoint Monitoring
####Goal
Measure that the individual calls give the functionally correct responses, so incorrectness is detected fast.
####Example
I check that the payment-options call gives me the correct
payment options.
####Limitation
Small checks, you only measure the parts but not the sum of the parts.

###Real User Monitoring
####Goal
Measure actual usability and performance of the website from the customers perspective.
####Example
I insert JavaScript (client-side code) to measure where
customers drop off, or experience slowness.
####Limitations
Less data when there is less usage (e.g., at night). Performance measurements are impacted by the capabilities of devices and connectivity of the user.

###Business Metrics 
####Goal
Use data from the different applications to get insights into the business goals to determine if there is an anomaly.
####Example
I measure the orders over time to detect whether I get
less orders then expected.
####Limitation
Anomaly Detection Less valuable when there is a low amount of traffic.
