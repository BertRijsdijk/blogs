#### You perceive your time to market for new features to be slow and want to speed up ...
You experience that things are sticky, and it's hard to finish anything within a sprint length. You've tried to deliver smaller 
increments, but it is still a struggle to complete these in a reasonable amount of time.

One of the reasons might be that wasteful activities and unnecessary handovers are hiding in your
development process. 

#### A Value Stream Map (VSM) can help you uncover this kinds of waste in your software delivery process

Value Stream Mapping is a form of lean-management and was one of the foundations that made the Toyota Production 
System. It maps the series of events that take a product or service from the beginning of the specific process (inception) 
until it reaches the customer. Even though it stems from a manufacturing world, it can be applied to software as well. 

#### How to do it?
I usually gather 

Now I can count the time for 

#### Should I use specialized tooling?
Tooling exists and can definitely make automation of the calculations easier, as well as repeatability. 
I find the results are better using brown paper on the wall though. The visual aspect of it is important 
and through collaborating interactively important insights are shared and a common understanding is reached

#### It is important to involve everyone


#### Can I do it just for the software team?
You can and it will be useful (For example in the form of a CI/CD pipeline), but most value is achieved throughout the 
complete value stream. If this is hard to organise in your project this could  

#### We are doing SCRUM. I've been told a VSM does not apply for SCRUM!
In SCRUM, the three pillars Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation should enable autonomous, T-shaped teams to 
self organise, optimize (and eliminate waste). In reality though, teams with various maturity levels struggle 
to do so. Often they are not aware of the wasteful nature of certain activities and the hidden cost of handovers so they
do not try to optimize this.  

Scrum masters and Agile Coaches often fail to effectively facilitate and challenge teams in this area. A VSM can help in
this scenario as well.

#### How to approach it with a SCRUM team then
Since roles usually matter less (only official roles in a SCRUM team are Dev, PO and SM!) I Focus more on the tasks then 
on who does it   

#### The implications of lots of handovers in knowledge work
Cost of context switching by loss of focus. Perhaps fine for a manufacturing process, but very costly to knowledge work
(link to blog the hidden cost of context switching)

#### Make your coaching effort 'measurable'



#### Other contexts where Value Stream Mapping can be provide Value
Creating a DevOps, CI/CD pipeline

#### Conclusions
VSM's can help you make . In my opinion it is an essential element in your coaching toolbox
