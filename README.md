#### You perceive your time to market for new features to be slow and want to speed up
You experience that things are sticky, and it's hard to finish anything within a sprint length. You've tried to deliver 
smaller increments, but it is still a struggle to complete these in a reasonable amount of time. 

One of the reasons might be that wasteful activities and unnecessary handovers are hiding in your
development process. 

#### A Value Stream Map (VSM) can help you uncover this kinds of waste in your software delivery process

Value Stream Mapping is a form of lean-management and was one of the foundations that made the Toyota Production 
System. It maps the series of events that take a product or service from the beginning of the specific process (inception) 
until it reaches the customer. Even though it stems from a manufacturing world, it can be applied to software as well. 

#### How to do it?
I usually gather everyone who is involved from the inception until the feature is in production. It is important to involve everyone

Now I can count the time for 


#### Can I do it just for the software team?
You can and it will be still be very useful for local optimization. The advantage is that a team can do it without any
dependencies on the rest of the organisation. It is smaller and is easier to organise. Do note though that most value is 
achieved by mapping the complete value stream. If this is hard to organise in your project this could point to an 
organisational and / or cultural problem.

#### We are doing Scrum. I've been told a VSM does not apply for Scrum teams
In Scrum, the three pillars Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation should enable autonomous, T-shaped teams to 
self organise, optimize (and eliminate waste). In reality though, teams with various maturity levels struggle 
to do so. Often they are not aware of the wasteful nature of certain activities and the hidden cost of handovers so they
do not try to optimize for this.  

Scrum masters and Agile Coaches often fail to effectively facilitate and challenge teams in this area. A VSM can help in
this scenario as well. 

I do make some adjustments: The only official roles in a Scrum team are Dev, PO and SM I tend to focus on the tasks 
and not work from roles. Furthermore (mature) Scrum teams tend to be less rigid and more fluid in terms of the flow of
work. Still, certain steps do always take place and lead to a picture as below, basically mirroring the CI/CD pipeline 
with all the human tasks required for each step.

#### Should I use specialized tooling?
Tooling exists and can definitely make automation of the calculations easier, as well as repeatability. 
I find the results are better using brown paper on the wall though. The visual aspect of it is important 
and through collaborating interactively important insights are shared and a common understanding is reached.

#### The implications of lots of handovers in knowledge work
Cost of context switching by loss of focus. Perhaps fine for a manufacturing process, but very costly to knowledge work

#### Make your coaching effort 'measurable'

#### Other contexts where Value Stream Mapping can be provide Value
Creating a DevOps, CI/CD pipeline

#### When would you not use it?

#### Conclusions
VSM's can help you make inefficiencies in the development process visible. In my opinion it is an essential element in 
the toolbox of any coach. Furthermore, for teams it tends to be inspiring anc can help kickstart a culture of continuous
improvement. Last but not least, it can make team progress and coaching results more tangible.
