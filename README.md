#### You trying to find the reasons your software development process is slow and want to speed up ...
You experience that things are sticky, and it's hard to finish user stories within a sprint length. You've tried to deliver smaller 
pieces of functionality but it is still a struggle to complete these in a reasonable amount of time.

One of the reasons might be that wasteful activities and unnecessary handovers are hiding in your
development process. 

#### A Value Stream Map (VSM) can help you uncover these kinds of waste
Value Stream Mapping is a form of lean-management and was one of the foundations that made the Toyota Production 
System. It maps the series of events that take a product or service from the beginning of the specific process until it reaches the customer.
Even though it stems from a manufacturing world, it can be applied to a software process as well.

#### How to do it
Having done this 

#### Involve everyone 

#### We are doing SCRUM. I've been told a VSM does not apply for SCRUM
In SCRUM, the three pillars Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation should enable autonomous, T-shaped teams to self-optimize 
there way of working to eliminate waste. In reality though teams with various maturity struggle to do this. Agile Coaches often 
fail to grasp 

one could be of the opinion that storypoints is a good enough measure and that optimisation will take place by autonomous teams
through retrospectives. In practice a lot of teams with various maturity struggle to do this themselves. Then 

Focus more on taks and less on roles

#### Other contexts where Value Stream Mapping can be applied
DevOps, CI/CD
