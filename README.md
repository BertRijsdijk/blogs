#### You trying to find the reasons your software development process is slow and want to speed up ...
You experience that things are sticky, and it's hard to finish user stories within a sprint length. You've tried to deliver smaller 
pieces of functionality but it is still a struggle to complete these in a reasonable amount of time.

One of the reasons might be that wasteful activities and unnecessary handovers are hiding in your
development process. 

#### A Value Stream Map (VSM) can help you uncover these kinds of waste
Value Stream Mapping is a form of lean-management and was one of the foundations that made the Toyota Production 
System. It maps the series of events that take a product or service from the beginning of the specific process (inception) 
until it reaches the customer. Even though it stems from a manufacturing world, it can be applied to a 
software process as well. 

#### How to do it
Having done this 

#### Involve everyone 

#### We are doing SCRUM. I've been told a VSM does not apply for SCRUM
In SCRUM, the three pillars Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation should enable autonomous, T-shaped teams too 
self organise to optimize and eliminate waste. In reality though, teams with various maturity levels struggle 
to do so simply because they are not consciously aware of the wasteful nature of handovers. 

A lot of teams initially tend to try to optimise the hands-on bits and not to think about 
what is in between (wait times) or how colaborating on activities can greatly 
reduce these handovers. They often don't really see it as a problem. 

Furthermore Scrum masters and Agile Coaches often fail to effectively facilitate and challenge teams in this 
because of a lack of technical knowledge or deep understanding of the development processes. 

A VSM can be helpful to calculate efficiency and visualize problems 

#### The implications of lots of handovers
Cost of context switching by loss of focus. Perhaps fine for a manufacturing process, but very costly to knowledge work
(link to blog the hidden cost of context switching)

#### Make your coaching effort 'measurable'

#### How to approach it with a SCRUM team
In a "classical" VSM I 
Focus more on taks and less on roles

#### Other contexts where Value Stream Mapping can be provide Value
Creating a DevOps, CI/CD pipeline
