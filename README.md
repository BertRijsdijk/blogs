#### You trying to find the reasons your software development process is slow and want to speed up ...
You experience that things are sticky, and it's hard to finish user stories within a sprint length. You've tried to deliver smaller 
pieces of functionality but it is still a struggle to complete these in a reasonable amount of time.

One of the reasons might be that wasteful activities and unnecessary handovers are hiding in your
development process. 

#### A Value Stream Map (VSM) can help you uncover these kinds of waste
Value Stream Mapping is a form of lean-management and was one of the foundations that made the Toyota Production 
System. It maps the series of events that take a product or service from the beginning of the specific process 
until it reaches the customer. Even though it stems from a manufacturing world, it can be applied to a 
software process as well. 

#### How to do it
Having done this 

#### Involve everyone 

#### We are doing SCRUM. I've been told a VSM does not apply for SCRUM
In SCRUM, the three pillars Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation should enable autonomous, T-shaped teams too self organise to optimize 
and eliminate waste. In reality though, teams with various maturity levels struggle to do so simply because they are not consciously aware of the wasteful
nature of some activities or they are not accustomed to this way of thinking. 


A lot of teams I worked with the initially tended to try to optimise the hands-on bit and not to think about what is in between (wait times) or how colaborating on activities can greatly 
reduce the number of handovers.


Scrum masters and Agile Coaches often fail to effectively facilitate and challenge teams in this because of a lack of technical knowledge. 
So that's where a VSM comes in handy, even in SCRUM


Focus more on taks and less on roles

#### Other contexts where Value Stream Mapping can be applied in software development
Creating a DevOps, CI/CD pipeline
