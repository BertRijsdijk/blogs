#### Are you looking gain a deeper insight into the reasons your software development process is slow?
You experience that things are sticky, and it's hard to finish stories in a sprint length. You tried to deliver smaller 
pieces of functionality but it is still a struggle to complete stories in a reasonable amount of time.

One of the reasons might be that wasteful activities and unnecessary handovers are hiding in your
development process. 

#### A Value Stream Map (VSM) can help you uncover these kinds of waste
Value Stream Mapping is a form of lean-management and was one of the foundations that made the Toyota Production 
System. It maps the series of events that take a product or service from the beginning of the specific process until it reaches the customer.
Even though it stems from a manufacturing world, it can be applied to a software process as well. 

#### How to do it
Having done this 



#### We are doing SCRUM. I've been told a VSM does not apply for SCRUM
In SCRUM, the three pillars Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation. These should enable autonomous and T-shaped teams
 to optimize...    

one could be of the opinion that storypoints is a good enough measure and that optimisation will take place by autonomous teams
through retrospectives. In practice a lot of teams with various maturity struggle to do this

Focus more on taks and less on roles

#### Other contexts where Value Stream Mapping can be applied
DevOps, CI/CD
