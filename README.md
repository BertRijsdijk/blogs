#### You perceive your time to market for new features to be slow and want to speed up ...
You experience that things are sticky, and it's hard to finish increments within a sprint length. You've tried to deliver smaller 
increments, but it is still a struggle to complete these in a reasonable amount of time.

One of the reasons might be that wasteful activities and unnecessary handovers are hiding in your
development process. 

#### A Value Stream Map (VSM) can help you uncover these kinds of waste
Value Stream Mapping is a form of lean-management and was one of the foundations that made the Toyota Production 
System. It maps the series of events that take a product or service from the beginning of the specific process (inception) 
until it reaches the customer. Even though it stems from a manufacturing world, it can be applied to software as well. 

#### How to do it
Although tooling exists 

#### Involve everyone 

#### We are doing SCRUM. I've been told a VSM does not apply for SCRUM!
In SCRUM, the three pillars Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation should enable autonomous, T-shaped teams to 
self organise, optimize (and eliminate waste). In reality though, teams with various maturity levels struggle 
to do so. Often they are not aware of the wasteful nature of certain activities and the hidden cost of handovers.  

They optimise individual tasks and are not aware what is in between (wait times) or how collaborating on activities 
can greatly reduce handovers. 

Scrum masters and Agile Coaches often fail to effectively facilitate and challenge teams in this area.

It can be helpful to calculate efficiency, visualize problems and  

#### How to approach 


#### The implications of lots of handovers in knowledge work
Cost of context switching by loss of focus. Perhaps fine for a manufacturing process, but very costly to knowledge work
(link to blog the hidden cost of context switching)

#### Make your coaching effort 'measurable'

#### How to approach it with a SCRUM team
In a "classical" VSM I 
Focus more on taks and less on roles

#### Other contexts where Value Stream Mapping can be provide Value
Creating a DevOps, CI/CD pipeline
